Morsel
======

**A Laravel REST API to allow communication between Arduino powered morse code transmitions**


Morsel goals and purpose
------------------------

**Basics**

1.  Morsel allows you to register and create an account
2.	There is a soft one to one correlation between an endpoint (arduino) and an account (in the future it may be possible to associate multiple devices with your account)
3.	With an account you can generate/view an API secret for "signing" requests
4.	When logged in, you can view the messages transmitted by your device to the API
5.	You can view/confirm that your message(s) were transmitted to the other device
